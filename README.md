# What's this?.
Basically, i found an old .patch file of a port of SDL2.0.1 for the PS3 (found in https://github.com/martell/PS3-PACKAGES/tree/master/ps3-SDL2).
This repository has that, expect with a small change so it compiles with modern PSL1GHT.

# What works?
I have only tested video, but audio and input might work too, so i'll try those out later and update this.

# How do i compile this?
Follow the instructions on the file "README.PSL1GHT".
